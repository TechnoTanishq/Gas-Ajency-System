# Gas-Ajency-System
Advance Project - This is a Gas Ajecy Management System Project with multiple webpages linked together .
<br><h3>Note : All the information available on this about the customers is dummy information.I had just tested this webpage multiple times and added new customers . It don't refer to any person.</h3><br><h4>For database and Authentication I had used Firebase database.</h4>
<br><p>Problem statement:<br> This is a client-facing online gas booking system that allows them to book gas
barrels whenever they need them. Instead of using the traditional way of obtaining
gas barrels over the phone, customers can now easily arrange for them and even
make payments. Clients have no other option than to wait because the standard
framework allocates a significant amount of time to handle solicitation. Every one
of these drawbacks is eliminated with this project. Clients and administrators will
both be able to access the system. The administrator is in charge of a large
number of client accounts and all of their details. At the start, all client accounts
will be assigned 12 barrels, which will come at a significant expense for only one
year.</p>
